# IdleGameSamples
Code samples from an idle game that I worked on in the past, for portfolio purposes

## Premise
The games original premise was an idle game with built in NFT functionality. Your NFTS (unicorn type characters), would be able to work and provide you with bonuses and buffs that improved generation of currency, which could be used to upgrade said characters.

## Files
There are a few sample files that show off multiple aspects of the project. These files were written in C# and were designed to be used in the game engine unity.
